# MTG React App

# Project Overview

This is a React app that pays tribute to one of my favorite cards games - Magic the Gathering! It features frontend and backend functionality.

The frontend employs the use of React, React Router, Material UI, and Pagination. The backend features API requests with fetch and useQuery, routes and controllers with Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database.

Cards can be searched by set name, individual card details can be viewed, and cards can be favorited (added to database) or deleted.

Testing is performed with react testing library, vitest, and cypress for end to end testing.
